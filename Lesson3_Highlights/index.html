            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before going through this lesson, I had not the slightest idea of what Version control was and/or what it entailed, but after going through the readings I now know a good deal. Version control in short is a main repository hub for all project files, which team members can interact and change anything all the while returning them back. A good tid-bit about Version control is that it tracks when files are changed and who changed them, as well as what the new changes are that have been changed. Another good thing about Version control is that it can merge changes to the same file that was used.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">More on Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The previous concept talked about what Version control was and how it is the main repository, however in this section will briefly touch on the many benefits of Version control. I believe that this topic is important because it lets the users know especially new users like myself exactly what the Version control system is all about. One of the benefits of Version control is that the files cannot be overwritten, and that multiple people can work on files at the same time without any kind of trouble. One other thing that I like about the benefits of Version control is that is allows users to revert back to older versions of files or project if need be. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Another important concept from the reading after learning about Version control is the remote repository, which resides on a remote server and is used among members of a team. There is also another repository called the local repository, which resides on a local machine, for example the laptop that I am using to do this assignment. The local repository is important because it can be created using to methods, such as creating a brand new from scratch, or by copying an existing remote repository onto my own machine. This information is important because it shows users what exactly a repositoryis and the ins and outs of how repositories work. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This topic is very important because in this lesson the git command is used quite often, however the question remains exactly what is git? In short, git is a free and open source that involves the Version control system and it is designed to handle all sorts of jobs and projects all the while operating at good speed and efficiency. One of the reasons why I think git so useful it is easy to work with and because of the commands. The commands are not hard at all to remember and the commands themselves have many advantages, such as the git status, which allows the user to see if there were any changes made prior, which can be very useful when adding a command by mistake. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Github</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this lesson, we were told to create an account for another site called Github, which links with the cloud9 website. The Github site utlizes everything that is used from cloud9 and mixes with it. The Github site is where the repositories are created and linked just like it is for assignment 3. The site is very useful because it stores all information once linked, such as the folders used for this assignment, which contains the css, fonts, and other files. While learning and using all of previous terms used mentioned earlier and putting them on the cloud9 site, then linking them with Github makes life much easier. </p>
